# Soy-Plant-growth-health

This project focuses on instance segmentation of
plant leaves using deep learning. The dataset consists of 428
top-view images of soy plants, annotated to distinguish leaves
from the background. Data augmentation techniques were
applied to improve model generalization and a pre-trained
convolutional neural network (CNN) was fine-tuned for the
task. The approach demonstrates the potential of deep learning-
ing for accurate leaf segmentation in controlled environments.
Also, this project focuses on calculating leaf area using the
polygonal technique, which applies the Shoelace formula to
annotated boundary coordinates. The method ensures precise
area computation without requiring machine learning models,
enabling efficient leaf growth analysis over time using COCO
dataset annotations. This project goes beyond just segmenting
leaves and calculating their area by using sequential images to explore how plants grow
over time. We tracked changes in photosynthetic activity and growth patterns by analyzing fluorescence
intensity metrics like total, mean, and normalized intensity. We also examined how environmental factors like temperature
and water availability influence leaf area and fluorescence. This work highlights how combining
computer vision, geometric calculations, and data analysis can
create a practical and scalable approach for monitoring plant
health in precision agriculture.
